# How to ship a release

1. Ensure that the project version number in [`packages/python/pyproject.toml`](packages/python/pyproject.toml) has been updated. Historically we have sometimes done this before the release. If not, change it now. Our versioning scheme is:
   | Release type | Version format | Notes |
   |--------------|----------------|-------|
   | Stable | YYYY.0.N | `N` starts at `0` and increments with each release during the year |
   | Release candidate | YYYY.O.NrcX | `YYYY.0.N` matches the upcoming stable release and `X` starts at `1` and increments with each RC |
   | Beta | YYYY.0.NbX | `YYYY.0.N` matches the upcoming stable release and `X` starts at `1` and increments with each beta release |
   | Alpha | YYYY.0.NaX | `YYYY.0.N` matches the upcoming stable release and `X` starts at `1` and increments with each alpha release |

1. Run the [`lsprotocol-Release` pipeline](https://dev.azure.com/devdiv/DevDiv/_build?definitionId=26767) against the `main` branch and check the `ðŸš€ Publish Package` checkbox.
1. Wait for the pipeline to reach the `WaitForValidation` stage.
1. Run the `pygls` tests against the new release:
    1. `git clone https://github.com/openlawlibrary/pygls`
    1. `cd pygls`
    1. `poetry install --all-extras` -- Save the path to the generated virtualenv
    1. `poetry run poe test` -- Baseline. Note which tests fail, if any. Don't run their `test-pyodide` tests.
    1. Download the `lsprotocol-*.tar.gz` file from the Github Release created by the pipeline.
    1. Remove the `lsprotocol` directory in the Poetry virtualenv and create a new one using the `lsprotocol` directory within the `tar.gz`.
    1. Rerun the tests -- Compare against baseline.
1. Once you're satisfied with the release, publish it by going to the `lsprotocol-Release` pipeline run that you started earlier and pressing the blue `Review` button and then pressing the blue `Resume` button to initiate publishing.
1. Publish the GitHub release (it was created as a draft).
